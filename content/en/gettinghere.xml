        <head>Getting Here: Travel to Victoria</head>
        <p>The University of Victoria is located on the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples, whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. Specifically, it is located on the ancestral land of the Lekwungen family group, Checkonien and Sungayka village. According to <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/services/indigenous/">Cheryl Bryce</a> of the Songhees Nation, the site “was known for camas harvesting, trading and cultural and spiritual practices.”</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.victoriaairport.com/">Victoria International Airport</a> (YYJ) is located approximately 30 minutes from the University of Victoria. Flights arrive daily from across Canada, the US, and Europe. In general, it is most cost efficient and convenient to fly into Victoria (rather than Vancouver or Seattle), unless you are coming from those areas or have other reasons to stop there during your trip.</p>
        <p>For getting to and from the airport, we recommend the <a href="https://yyjairportshuttle.com/">YYJ Airport Shuttle</a>; you may need to call and confirm a shuttle spot or time. The cost is $25 CAD for one adult; less if you are traveling in a group of two or more. Specific fares and schedules can be found on their website. A taxi to downtown Victoria hotels from the airport will cost approximately $60 CAD.</p>
        <p>Float plane service is available from Vancouver (<a href="https://www.harbourair.com/">Harbour Air</a>) and Seattle (<a href="http://www.kenmoreair.com/">Kenmore Air</a>) to Victoria's Inner Harbour. Helicopter service between Vancouver and Victoria's downtown Inner Harbour is also available (<a href="http://helijet.com/">HeliJet</a>).</p>
